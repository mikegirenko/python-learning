"""
In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman:
Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left (Display
"You have 4 incorrect guesses left")
Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed,
donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
